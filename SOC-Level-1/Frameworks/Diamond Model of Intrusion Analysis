# Diamond Model of Intrusion Analysis (TryHackMe)

> **Room:** Diamond Model  
> **Platform:** TryHackMe  
> **Difficulty:** Easy (~35 min)

## 📚 Introduction

The Diamond Model of Intrusion Analysis was developed in 2013 by:

- Sergio Caltagirone
- Andrew Pendergast
- Christopher Betz

It defines any intrusion as an event connecting four core features in a diamond shape:

- **Adversary**
- **Infrastructure**
- **Capability**
- **Victim**

Two additional axes enhance the analysis:

- **Social-Political Component**
- **Technology Component**

✅ **Why learn it?**

- Understand how intrusions happen
- Explain incidents clearly, even to non-technical people
- Correlate events to adversary campaigns
- Predict adversary actions
- Create actionable threat intelligence

---

## 🔎 Task 2 - Adversary

- The adversary is the hacker, threat actor, or group behind the attack.
- Responsible for using a capability against the victim.
- Types:
  - **Adversary Operator:** Executes the attack.
  - **Adversary Customer:** Gains the benefit from the attack.

---

## 🎯 Task 3 - Victim

- The victim is the adversary’s target.
- Could be:
  - Individual or organization
  - Email, IP, domain
- Two parts:
  - **Victim Personae:** Who is targeted (e.g. company name, role).
  - **Victim Assets:** The systems/accounts being attacked.


## ⚔️ Task 4 - Capability

- Tools, skills, and techniques used in the attack.
- Examples:
  - Malware
  - Phishing kits
  - Exploits
- Related terms:
  - **Capability Capacity:** Vulnerabilities exploited by a capability.
  - **Adversary Arsenal:** Complete set of capabilities an adversary possesses.
---

## 🛠️ Task 5 - Infrastructure

- Physical or logical systems used by adversaries to:
  - Deliver capabilities
  - Maintain control
- Examples:
  - C2 servers
  - IP addresses
  - Malicious domains
  - Compromised email accounts
  - Malicious USBs
- Types:
  - **Type 1:** Directly owned by the adversary.
  - **Type 2:** Operated through intermediaries, often unknowingly, to hide attribution.


## ⏲️ Task 6 - Event Meta Features

Optional features enriching Diamond Model analysis:

- **Timestamp:** Date/time of the event.
- **Phase:** Stages of an attack (e.g. Kill Chain).
- **Result:** Whether the attack succeeded, failed, or is unknown.
- **Direction:** Data flow (e.g. Infra → Victim).
- **Methodology:** Type of attack (e.g. phishing, DDoS).
- **Resources:** What the attack needs (e.g. malware, funds, servers).


## 🌍 Task 7 - Social-Political Component

- Describes **why** the adversary acts:
  - Financial gain
  - Hacktivism
  - Espionage
  - Reputation in hacker communities

Example:

> Using a victim’s computer for cryptomining, generating financial profit for the adversary.

---

## 🖥️ Task 8 - Technology Component

- Connects **Capability** and **Infrastructure.**
- Describes how an attack is technically executed.

Example:

> A watering-hole attack where adversaries compromise a website likely visited by their targets.

---

## 📝 Task 9 - Practice Analysis

- Complete the Diamond Model via a static web exercise in TryHackMe.
- Involves populating all 8 sections for a real-world case.


## ✅ Task 10 - Conclusion

- The Diamond Model:
  - Scientifically structures intrusion analysis
  - Improves threat intelligence workflows
  - Supports proactive defense
  - Helps communicate threats clearly to non-technical audiences

---

## ⭐ Benefits of Diamond Model

- Maps **who → what → how → where** in attacks.
- Supports:
  - Incident response
  - Threat intelligence
  - Executive reporting
