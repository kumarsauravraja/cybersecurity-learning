## The 6 Levels of the Pyramid

| Level | Indicator Type | Example | Difficulty for Attacker |
|-------|----------------|---------|------------------------|
| 1 | Hash Values | File hash (MD5, SHA256) | Easy to change |
| 2 | IP Addresses | Malicious IP | Easy to change |
| 3 | Domain Names | Malicious domain | Moderate |
| 4 | Network/Host Artifacts | Registry keys, file paths | Harder |
| 5 | Tools | Cobalt Strike, Mimikatz | Very hard |
| 6 | TTPs | Lateral movement techniques | Extremely hard |

## Why It Matters
Higher in the pyramid = more pain for attackers because changing TTPs takes time, money, and skill.
